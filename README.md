# README

This notebook contains my work relating to Kaggle Learn courses and their associated competitions.

## Reference Notebooks

For some of the Kaggle Learn courses I made reference notebooks which summarizes the coding techniques covered in the course in a single notebook, usually in the context of a submission to the associated competition.

* [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/rsizem2/kaggle-learn-reference-feature-engineering)

## Ames Housing

The notebooks in the `ames housing prices` directory involve predicting housing prices from the [Ames Housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) done as part of the [Housing Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview). The techniques used are adapted from the Intermediate Machine Learning and Feature Engineering courses on Kaggle.

## MNIST

The notebooks in the `mnist digit recognition` directory involve the famous MNIST data set as part of the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition.
