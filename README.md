# README

The notebooks in this repository involve predicting housing prices from the [Ames Housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) done as part of the [Housing Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview).

The techniques used are adapted from those covered in the [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) and [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) courses on Kaggle. I also made two reference notebooks for these courses which you can find here:

* [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/rsizem2/kaggle-learn-reference-intermediate-ml)
* [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/rsizem2/kaggle-learn-reference-feature-engineering)

I am unlikely to update the code in this repository unless I decide to revisit this later.
